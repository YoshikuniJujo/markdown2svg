markdown2svg
============

I'm sorry. You can't compile this package now. The package which this package depends is too old.

# Installation
This program is available on [hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/markdown2svg).
You need to have [haskell-platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/) installed then:
```
cabal update
cabal sandbox init
cabal install markdown2svg 

```
